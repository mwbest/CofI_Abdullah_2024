This repository has a tutorial notebook for multi-slit reduction. It also has all the necessary files and codes to run the notebook.
It is still in trial mode. Thus, there might be some hiccups. If any, feedback is music to these ears. I hope you have fun reducing data.

**CofI KOSMOS slitmask reduction final draft-optimized** is the recent one to use for reduction it allows user to extract star with an appropriate radius.
**This running on the new astro-pyvista (version 0.4.0)** make sure yours up to date before running the notebook.
