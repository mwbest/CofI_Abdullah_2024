This repository has a tutorial notebook for multi-slit reduction. It also has all the necessary files and codes to run the notebook.
It is still in trial mode. Thus, there might be some hiccups. If any, feedback is music to these ears. I hope you have fun reducing data.

**new_workflow_draft** is the recent one to use for reduction it allows user to extract star with an appropriate radius.
**There will be new update coming for wavelength adjustment so keep an eye fro that.**
